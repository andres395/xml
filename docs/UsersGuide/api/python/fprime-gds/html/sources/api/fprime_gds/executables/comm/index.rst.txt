:mod:`fprime_gds.executables.comm`
==================================

.. py:module:: fprime_gds.executables.comm

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   comm.py:

   This is the F prime communications adapter. This allows the F prime ground tool suite to interact with running F prime
   deployments that exist on the other end of a "wire" (some communication bus). This is done with the following mechanics:

   1. An adapter is instantiated to handle "read" and "write" functions against the wire
   2. A framer/deframer is instantiated in order to frame/deframe those packets as transported across the wire.
   3. "Uplink" and "Downlink" threads are created to loop on data from flight (F prime) and ground (F prime ground)
      interfaces ensuring that ground data is framed and written to the wire, and flight data is deframed and sent to the
      ground side.

   Note: assuming the module containing the ground adapter has been imported, then this code should provide it as a CLI
         argument, removing the need to rewrite most of this class to use something different.
