.. py:class:: PktXmlLoader

   Bases: :class:`fprime_gds.common.loaders.xml_loader.XmlLoader`

   Class to load xml packet dictionaries

   .. attribute:: PKT_LIST_TAG
      :annotation: = packet_list

      

   .. attribute:: PKT_TAG
      :annotation: = packet

      

   .. attribute:: CH_TAG
      :annotation: = channel

      

   .. attribute:: NAME_FIELD
      :annotation: = name

      

   .. attribute:: ID_FIELD
      :annotation: = id

      

   .. attribute:: CH_NAME_FIELD
      :annotation: = name

      

   .. method:: get_id_dict(self, path, ch_name_dict)


      Returns the python dictionary keyed by ids for the given path

      This function will return the same dictionary originally computed for
      the given path or will construct new dictionaries if the path has never
      been passed to the get_id_dict or the get_name_dict functions.

      :param path: Path to the xml pkt spec to convert to a python dict
      :type path: string
      :param ch_name_dict: Channel dictionary with names as keys and
                           ChTemplate objects as values.
      :type ch_name_dict: dict()

      :returns: The id dictionary associated with the given path


   .. method:: get_name_dict(self, path, ch_name_dict)


      Returns the python dictionary keyed by names for the given path

      This function will return the same dictionary originally computed for
      the given path or will construct new dictionaries if the path has never
      been passed to the get_id_dict or the get_name_dict functions.

      :param path: Path to the xml pkt spec to convert to a python dict
      :type path: string
      :param ch_name_dict: Channel dictionary with names as keys and
                           ChTemplate objects as values.
      :type ch_name_dict: dict()

      :returns: The name dictionary associated with the given path


   .. method:: construct_dicts(self, path, ch_name_dict)


      Constructs and returns python dictionaries keyed on id and name

      This function should not be called directly, instead, use
      get_id_dict(path) and get_name_dict(path)

      :param path: Path to the packet definition xml file to parse into
                   a dictionary.
      :type path: string
      :param ch_name_dict: Channel dictionary with names as keys and
                           ChTemplate objects as values.
      :type ch_name_dict: dict()

      :returns: (id_dict, name_dict). The keys should be the packets' id and name
                fields respectively and the values should be PktTemplate objects.
      :rtype: A tuple with two packet dictionaries (type==dict())
