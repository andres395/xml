.. py:class:: TestHistory(filter_pred=None)

   Bases: :class:`fprime_gds.common.history.history.History`

   A receive-ordered history to support the GDS test api. This history adds support for specifying
   start with predicates and python's bracket notation.

   .. attribute:: __test__
      :annotation: = False

      

   .. method:: data_callback(self, data, sender=None)


      Data callback to push an object on the history. This callback will only add data_objects
      that satisfy the filter predicate.

      :param data: object to store


   .. method:: retrieve(self, start=None)


      Retrieve objects from this history. If a starting point is specified, will return a
      sub-list of all objects beginning at start to the latest object.
      Note: if no item satisfies the start predicate or the index is greater than the length of
      the history, an empty list will be returned.

      :param start: optional first object to retrieve. can either be an index (int) or a predicate.

      :returns: a list of objects in chronological order


   .. method:: retrieve_new(self)


      Retrieves a chronological order of objects that haven't been accessed through retrieve or
      retrieve_new before.

      :returns: a list of objects in chronological order


   .. method:: clear(self, start=None)


      Clears objects from history. A clear that specifies a starting point will clear the history
      such that start becomes the earliest element in the history after objects are removed. If
      the start is specified as a predicate, start will be the earliest object to satisfy the
      predicate.
      Note: if no item satisfies the start predicate or the index is greater than the length of
      the history, all items will be cleared.

      :param start: clear all objects before start. start can either be an index or a predicate.


   .. method:: size(self)


      Accessor for the number of objects in the history
      :returns: the number of objects (int)


   .. method:: __len__(self)


      Accessor for the number of objects in the history
      :returns: the number of objects


   .. method:: __getitem__(self, index)


      __get_item__ is a special method in python that allows using brackets.
      Example: item = history[2] # this would return the second item in the history.

      :param index: the index of the array to return.

      :returns: the item at the index specified.


   .. method:: __get_index(self, start)


      finds the index that start specifies
      :param start: an indicator of a position in an order can be a predicate or an index in
                    the ordering

      :returns: the index in the given list that start refers to
