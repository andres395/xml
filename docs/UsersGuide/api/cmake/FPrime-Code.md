## FPrime-Code:

FPrime code. This cmake file includes the basic directories that make up the mainline F prime framework. This is
separated from the CMake includes themselves such that this is built after all CMake setup. All F prime core folders
should be added here and F prime CMake API function should be added elsewhere.

Note: given F prime's historical folder structure, this is not organized as an fprime library.
